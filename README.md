# Data_Wrangling_Project
Data Wrangling project for my Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree.
In this project, I was working with the dataset from the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates or WeRateDogs.  WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.
I effectively wrangled the data which involved gathering additional data from other datasets, assessing the data for any quality and tidiness issues and cleaning the data. where I found any fault.
